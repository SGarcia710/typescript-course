// If a variable can be used with differents types (for example when we use Union | ) we make our program uncertain because we will not know exactly what the variable will have. For this we have the Type Guards

// Unlike Type of from JavaScript, with Type Guards we only check the variable one Time and we will know what type the variable is.

// function isNumber(obj: number | string): obj is number {
//   return obj as number;
// }
